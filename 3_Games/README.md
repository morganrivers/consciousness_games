This trains the model in an analogous way as humans and social animals are trained to understand their own motives, the motives of others, and understand effective communication.


There is a part of the training which teaches the model to understand the properties of other agents, in order to win tactical games against them, and to cooperate with them.


Rock paper scissors, poker:
Each game is played such that the agent is told what other agents they are playing against or with. The name will be indicating that the opponent in question is taking a simple consistent strategy, or whether it is a different agent at a different point of training, or with different training. The intent is to allow agents to learn that names of agents correspond to specific behavior characteristics of these different agents. In order to earn maximal reward, the agents will learn how to effectively guess what strategies and behaviors other agents will exhibit in these games.

These games do not involve verbal communication.



Territory game:

Territory game involves the placement of your pieces in a way that you have control over the territory adjacent to you in your grid. The number of pieces within one grid square of a location (maximum 8 pieces surround any grid location) determines whether you will be able to place a piece there. If an opponent has the same number of pieces within one grid distance away, then it is a draw and neither can place. However, if you and another player choose to cooperate, then your piece influences add, so cooperating is good. At the end, when there are no spots left to play, the player with the most placed pieces wins.

Territory game involves another level of skill, in that it involves direct communication. The agents are allowed to communicate using natural language with other agents about whether they will cooperate or defect. This allows them to choose the correct other agents to cooperate with, when selecting agents to cooperate with in each new game. The communication also allows the agents to prevent collisions occurring between two agents, as that would put them behind in the game against other agents.

Territory game also requires theory of mind, in that you must guess the skill level of other agents when choosing who to cooperate with, and understand that some agents (the ones that are preprogrammed to follow certain strategies or act randomly) do not respond to language.



Cooperate Q&A:

This game is cooperative. 

Two "language models" interact to attempt to answer a question which only one of them can answer correctly due to past training. One of the two is randomly selected to speak first to the other, and the other responds. Then, one of them is randomly asked to answer the question. They are both rewarded if the final answer (decided randomly by one of them) is correct. This teaches them to judge whether another model is more likely to know the final answer.


Introspection training:

Language models are asked a series of questions which relate to their situation and personal attributes, which have known answers. They must recognize that these questions refer to themselves, the text they generate, and their internal model parameters, and will learn to accurately answer questions about their personal attributes with natural language. This prepares the agent for the ACT test. 


The necessary aspects of consciousness these games cover are as follows:

Rock paper scissors, poker: Theory of mind

Cooperate Q&A: Theory of mind, natural language communication, introspection.

Territory game: Theory of mind, future planning, cooperation, natural language communication, development of preferences.

Introspection training: Introspection, situational awareness, self recognition
