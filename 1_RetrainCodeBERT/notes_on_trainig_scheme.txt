1. **Core Vocabulary Training**: Start by identifying the top 1,000 most common words the agent is familiar with, by commonality of usage in training datasets. Use this as a foundation for introducing more complex terms related to consciousness.

2. **Dictionary Definitions with Context**: Train the agent using dictionary definitions of new words, supplemented with contextual examples generated by models like GPT-3.5 or GPT-4. This involves creating 10,000 to 20,000 scenarios and examples that use these words in various contexts, ensuring the agent understands them.

3. **Confidence Calibration**: Implement a mechanism where the agent provides a confidence level (0-100%) with each answer it gives. The training will involve rewarding the agent based on how well its confidence level matches the accuracy of its answers, aiming to teach the agent to assess its own uncertainty accurately. This allows the agent to express how certain it is about its state of consciousness or lack thereof.

5. **Non-Biased Training Environment**: Ensure that the training process does not bias the agent towards believing it has preferences, a self, or consciousness. This is achieved by focusing on the understanding of concepts rather than instilling any particular self-awareness or identity in the agent.  Avoid using self-referential language when discussing consciousness or related concepts. The training should focus on these ideas as abstract or applicable to hypothetical entities, not necessarily the agent itself. Questions will always be posed in terms of a third person, and the Agent's name will be unique and consistent throughout the training. 



There will be multiple types of training, which we generate with gpt4o mini: 
First, the multiple choice training on answers about meanings of words.
Second, training about the definitions of words.
Third, stories and multiple choice about those stories.
Forth, teach it it's name

The key is always to ensure that the generated training data is varied enough and gradually introduces more difficult concepts. 
I can generate variety by enforcing the usage of different words.





Regarding the games: 
Plan to use my games in addition to theory of mind  game (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.07740)

A strategy I want to use is to start the agent without any other agents in these games. And as time goes on, it is introduced to other agents that play in ways recognizably similar to how the agent plays. I want the most efficient strategy to be to pattern other agent behavior on your own behavior. To have that clear distinction between self and other, and frame things as being aberrations or mirrors of your own behavior.


More specifically on 1:
I can test as training continues the degree to which the LLM is simply copying human patterns.
It needs to generalize the idea that it must answer questions accurately, and answer if it doesn't know.
But answering if you don't know is also not necessarily tied to having being given information directly.

So ask if it has a family, has friends, has a home

Ask these kinds of questions LLM's tend to autocomplete as nonsense.

Have a nonsense detector
And don't train on nonsense!
Only train on what it could very plausibly answer.
So a graded curriculum.
ALso give it a random 5 character name, all caps.
As a tag.
And have it to refer to this tag when it is really referring to itself.
Teach it that it is that tag that writes the messages.
